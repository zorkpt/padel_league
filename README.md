# Padel League Management Platform

## Objective

The objective of the Padel League Management Platform is to create a web-based solution aimed at casual, non-professional padel players. It seeks to 'professionalize' friendly padel matches by simplifying the organization, participation, and management of local padel leagues. The platform aims to provide an accessible, efficient, and user-friendly tool for the grassroots padel community, enhancing the social aspect of the game while adhering to good software development practices.

## Development Goals

2. **Dynamic League Management:** Enable users to create, join, and manage leagues. Track active league members and their rankings within the league.

3. **Messaging:** Implement a messaging system that enables users to communicate with each other within the platform, contributing to a more collaborative and interactive user experience.

4. **League-Specific Chat System:** Each league should have its own dedicated chat for discussions related to matches, strategies, and other league-specific topics.

5. **Notification System:** Develop a notification system to alert users about upcoming matches, changes in the league, and other important updates.

6. **Test Coverage:** Strive for comprehensive test coverage to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

7. **Code Quality:** Aim for clean, maintainable code following industry best practices.
